To find the minimum power of an given integer such that the number produced has the digits of 0-9 

I came across this problem on a forum. 

Part a was simply given a number, x, (an integer), find the minimum power of the integer, let's say power y, such that the number produced by doing the operation: x^y. the digits of that number produced must consist of the numbers from 0-9 (i.e. 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). I tried to tackle the problem using brute force which is proven successfully since the main question was simply to find the minimum power for 2 and the correct answer was 68.

Part b was a bit harder which was to find given 2 numbers, we have to determine the total minimum power such that the two numbers consist of number 0-9. I solved the problem by using brute force method and combining the funciton made in part a.

Moving forward, I'm trying to solve this problem given 3 numbers and try to find a more effective algorithm instead of simply using brute force.
